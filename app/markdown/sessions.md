From basic imaging and paper file conversions, to modern day enterprise content management platforms, schools are looking for technology to help meet growing demands from students and staff alike.

# Using a Data Warehouse to Automate VFA (or any!) Reporting Requirements

The primary goal of Pima’s data warehouse project is to provide wider access to the College’s mission and KPI measures while simultaneously delivering more data for interactive exploration using a modern business intelligence platform. Such a large undertaking for a college that had a limited BI deployment in the past, raised the usual issues of data availability, consistency, and understanding. 

An effective approach to address this challenge is to choose a defined purpose and outcome for the first phases of the data warehouse. Starting with ASR’s “Student Success Analytics” (SSA) data warehouse model, Pima chose the Voluntary Framework of Accountability (VFA) metrics and iteratively build interactive reports and dashboards in SSA to address these requirements. The VFA is a practical, comprehensive, user-centric report that related closely to the College’s mission and KPI measures and requires a detailed understanding of the institution’s business processes. This approach has significantly improved PCC’s reporting practices to meet end users’ expectations and deliver significant value to the College’s business. However, any similar reporting initiative like Complete College America (CCA) could also be used. 

We will discuss keys aspects of this challenging task, including:

* Model construction 
* Locating data sources
* Transforming the data
* Building dimensions
* Defining measures
* Designing visualizations
* Data validation

*Presenter(s):  John Van Weeren, ASR Analytics, LLC*
